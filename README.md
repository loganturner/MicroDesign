# 68k-based single-board microcomputer

This was my final project in an undergraduate microcomputer design course. It's not a great design, but it functions. Maybe it can inspire others working on something similar.

## Tools

- The schematic and PCB were designed in PCB Artist. ([Latest version here](https://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-layout-software/).)
    - I have not tried to open these files in the latest version of PCB Artist. The version used was probably 2.0, which can be downloaded [here](https://pcb-artist.informer.com/2.0/).
- The 68k assembly was written and tested in [EASy68k](http://www.easy68k.com).
- More info including a parts list is in [this PDF report](/img/report.pdf).
